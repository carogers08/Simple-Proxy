Instructions to run:

Open CMD and route to folder where "Proxy Server.jar" file is contained. If you are at the home directory of the project we turned in then it should be "Proxy Server\out\artifacts\Proxy_Server_jar". Type "java "Proxy Server.jar" to run the proxy server. The server should be running on the localhost ip (127.0.0.1 for windows 10), and be using the port number 1234. Use this information in your proxy setup for Firefox. Use at will.
